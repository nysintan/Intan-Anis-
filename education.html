<p align = "center"> <font size="5" color="black">This is my elementary school from kindergarten to sixth grade. I go to school here because my father is one of the teachers in this school. I really enjoyed my school days here and really miss coming here again. The teachers and friends here are very good. Even if we don't see each other again, I will still remember the moment with them.

<p align = "center"> <font size="5" color="black">This was my high school from first grade to fifth grade. There are various sweet and bitter experiences that I went through at school. All experiences make me who I am now. However, I am very happy to be one of the former students here. I was a librarian at school. Until now, I still keep in touch with my friends from school.

<p align = "center"> <font size="5" color="black">This is my current place of study. I took a diploma in information management. In this cost, I was able to learn many things including catalog library, record file, archive and also the system. I am not an excellent student but I will also try to achieve my dreams. The new friends I met here gave me a lot of support in this academic field. Hopefully I can end my diploma days with flying colours.
